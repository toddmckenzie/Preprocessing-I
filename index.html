    <h2>Why I code?</h2>
    <p>The reason I started coding in April of 2018 was out of curiosity.  I came to a period of my life where I became curious about many things that I did not know.
      Coding was not the only thing that I became curious about but it was the one thing I fell in love with doing.  The reason code caught my attention so strong was
      because of the ability to make me struggle and think about a problem for awhile.  I like to keep my mind focused on a problem and then the feeling I get when it gets solved
      is awesome.  There is always something to learn in the tech industry!</p>
